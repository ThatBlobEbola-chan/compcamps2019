  <p class='text text--para'>This year in camp, I made a website and online shop/bidding forum with Javin for CompCoin, and it ended up being pretty successful. As of the end of the week, our shared account is the wealthiest owned by Campers, and beaten only by the administrator account.</p>
  <p class='text text--para'><a href="https://aholicknight.github.io/coinroad1/index.html">Link to Coin Road</a></p>

  <p class='text text--para'>We also had various antics, such as Thursday's great conspiracy to "Robin Hood" the CompCoin of the formerly-wealthy camper Ryan, to which we created a USB to take the files for his CompCoin Miner from. When this didn't work, we took... Shadier methods that I won't disclose. Also, sorry Ryan, but the spice must flow.</p>
  <p class='text text--para'>On a more minor note, we also had a photoshop class, in which I took the opportunity to create that beautiful edit of Dalton's face as seen on the previous page. We also worked in the game engine Unity, but I didn't do anything major with it this week. Shoutout to Will and AJ for making a bombin' Pokemon fight system in it.</p>
